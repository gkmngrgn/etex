# etex
Love LaTeX. Prepare your cv, resume, cover letters quickly.

If you're too lazy to install all LaTeX dependencies to your PC (like me), just open an [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) account and clone the project.

Remember that the compiler should be "XeLaTeX". You can preview all the settings [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qxbxfdspntvw).

You can set a default font in [main.cls](https://github.com/gkmngrgn/etex/blob/main/src/main.cls#L13).
